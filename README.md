# Horizons in Cosmology
For me, horizons are among the most beautiful concepts in cosmology. Here I share some notes and plots I made. One can get a lot of information from these plots, maybe (and very likely, if you have not spent a lot of time thinking about this) more than you expected!



More notes, plots and explanations will be uploaded later.
